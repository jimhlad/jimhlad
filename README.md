# Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Jim Hlad and I'm a software developer from Canada ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦!

I have over 10 years of experience building robust and feature-rich web applications and APIs. Some of my recent areas of interest include **Laravel**, **Vue.js** and **GraphQL**. I'm passionate about writing clean code and keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. I'm also a big believer in open source software and enjoy contributing to various community projects.
