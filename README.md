# Hi there 👋

My name is Jim Hlad and I'm a software developer from Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦!

I have over 10 years of experience building web applications and APIs. Some of my recent areas of interest include **PHP**, **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, **Python** and **data science**. I'm passionate about writing clean code and keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.
